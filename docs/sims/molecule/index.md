# Molecule Viewer

This is a 700+ JavaScript program written in React with the three.js library
for doing 3D rendering of molecules.  We only have a small list for demos.

[Run the Molecule Viewer](main.html)

## Next Steps

Refactor to put molecules into individual JSON files.  Only load one
molecule at a time.

## Developer Notes

### Console Errors

Those are mostly development warnings, but let me fix the React 18 warning by updating the code to use the new `createRoot` API instead of the deprecated `ReactDOM.render`.Perfect! I've updated the code to fix the React 18 warning. Now save the updated `molecule.js` file and refresh your page.

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues:**
- **ReactDOM.render warning** - Now uses the modern `createRoot` API

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Remaining Warnings Explained:**
The other console messages are normal for development and don't affect functionality:

1. **"Download React DevTools"** - Just a helpful suggestion for developers
2. **"cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production"** - Normal warning when using Tailwind via CDN (fine for development)
3. **"You are using the in-browser Babel transformer"** - Expected when transpiling JSX in the browser (fine for development)
4. **"Enabled live reload"** - Some development feature that's running
5. **"readystatechange handler took 156ms"** - Performance notice from Babel transpiling (normal for development)

## üöÄ **For Production Use:**
If you wanted to eliminate all warnings for a production app, you'd need to:

- Install Tailwind CSS properly via PostCSS
- Pre-compile your JSX using a build tool like Webpack/Vite
- Use React production builds
- Set up a proper development server

But for development and testing, these warnings are completely normal and the app works perfectly! Your 3D molecular visualizer should now run without any React warnings.
